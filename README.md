Python Assignment

1. Problem Statement 1
Define a ML technique that you would use for the fake news detection.
Build a Machine learning Model to detect the Fake new detection.
We could use online Jupyter Lab or similar environment to build, train and test the model
You could use your choice of dataset for the training and testing this model or any 
dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=Fake+news (source-based-news-classification)
Based on the Test data set you should also be able to identify the accuracy of the Model

2.Problem Statement 2
Create an Image Analytics script to detect License Number plate in the images.
You could use OpenCV or Libraries of your choice. The application should draw a bounding box around the License plate and blur the license plate.
We could use online Jupyter Lab or similar environment to build this.
Hint: you could use OpenCV cascade Classifier for this exercise
